- [x] make it easy to make TODOs (`,v`)
- [x] fix fugitive setup (keymap and rhubarb)
- [x] remove hover.nvim (I don't care about those features, plus put the K keymap back)
- [x] fix the diagnostic pop ups, it doesn't show on `]d` any more
- [ ] `af` object doesn't work anymore, this used to come from treesitter?
- [ ] remember file position on next open?
